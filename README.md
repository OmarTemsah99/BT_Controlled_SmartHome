A simple Avr project made on the atmega32 for a mobile home application,

there can be better projects obviously, but I like to think this one works well enough for everyone 
you just need to change the use of the Watchdog instead of it reseting the entire microcontroller make it go back to the start menu since it's unhealthy for the atmega32 to keep resetting it self.
hope you find this project useful or an inspiration (^-^).
